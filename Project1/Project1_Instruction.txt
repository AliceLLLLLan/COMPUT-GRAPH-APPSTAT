•Build a function which:
– takes as input a data frame, and the two elements of a frame that you want to model
–Plot the data fit with a smoothing spline with the default cross validation, vs the smoothing spline with 2 degrees of freedom (linear fit).
–Test the difference of fit using the F test
–Plot the normal quantile quantile plots for the residuals
